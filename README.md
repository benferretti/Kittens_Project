## Presentation
We are a team composed of five loving cats members : Amaury, Juliet, Julien, Benoit and Benjamin. The point of this website was to complete our first group project for a [bootcamp](https://www.thehackingproject.org/). It is a factice marketplace where you can buy picture of little monsters know as kitties.
